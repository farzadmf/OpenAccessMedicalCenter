COMP 353 Summer 2015 Project (Open Access Medical Center)
=========================================================

This is the play application we are going to use to write the project.

To make sure the application can successfully connect to the database
in your local machine, do the following:

* Create a database in MySQL named **comp353oamc**
* Create a user in MySQL named **comp353**
* Set the password for the user to **comp353**
